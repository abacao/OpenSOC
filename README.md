***Trouble Shooting MISP installation***

If you get a few errors during the MISP installation process, exit the script and run the following commands:
- pecl uninstall brotli simdjson zstd
- rm -rf /var/www/MISP /var/www/.cache
- mysql -u root -e "DROP DATABASE misp;"
- mysql -u root -e "DROP USER 'misp'@'localhost';"
- mysql -u root -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"


In case the password for MISP doesn't show up, please run the following command to generate a new password for the default user account:

- /var/www/MISP/app/Console/cake user change_pw admin@admin.test P+sswordCyber2025
